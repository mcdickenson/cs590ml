Version: 1.06

Changes in version 1.06
Added glyphs and support files for full textcomp (TS1) in all styles.

Changes in version 1.05
Corrected to some extent the behavior of commas in math mode.

Changes in version 1.04
Corrected two errors in zgm.map which were causing incorrect behavior with \includegraphics.

Changes in version 1.03
Addition of t1zgm1.fd, so that footnote markers render correctly. Also minor adjustments to metrics.

Changes in version 1.02
The xheight (\fontdimen5) for regular weight italic provided in previous versions was incorrect, leading to a wrongly placed vector math accent. This has been corrected, and the math metrics have been further refined. If using version 1.08 or later of newtx, you will see a much improved result from, eg, $\vec{x}$.

Changes in version 1.01
The original metrics for GaramondNo8 led to collisions between parentheses, brackets, braces and upper-case glyphs. These are modified in this version to reduce collisions, at the cost of increased spacing around those glyphs. The fontinst source files are now included, and a version of the documentation in French is provided, thanks to René Fritz.

To install:

Expand garamondx.zip into an otherwise empty temporary folder, open a Terminal window
and cd to that temporary folder, and type

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c
sudo /bin/cp -Rfp * /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
sudo echo Map zgm.map >> /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg
sudo mktexlsr
sudo -H updmap-sys

Installation:

Mac OS X: To install, open a Terminal window and cd to inside the downloaded TDS folder.

Method A (recommended): type

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c
sudo cp -Rfp * /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
sudo echo Map zgm.map >> /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg
sudo mktexlsr
sudo -H updmap-sys

Method B: If you insist on making your font installations in your home folder, potentially making your personal installation become out of sync with updates to TeXLive, use instead

(i) if you checked Update for All Users in TeXLive utility

cp -Rfp * ~/Library/texmf

then

updmap --enable Map=zgm.map

(ii) otherwise

cp -Rfp * ~/Library/texmf

then

sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=zgm.map

Linux: Very similar to Mac OS X.

MikTeX: Copy the garamondx.tds.zip to the root of the folder you use for personal additions to the TeX trees, open a command window, chdir to that folder, and type

unzip garamondx.tds
initexmf --update-fndb
initexmf --edit-config-file updmap

The latter command should open updmap.cfg in your default editor, commonly Notepad. Add the line 

Map garamondx.map 

to updmap.cfg, save and close. Then, in the command window, type

initexmf --mkmaps

You can ignore error messages that may occur here. This should result in a properly enabled garamondx.
